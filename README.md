# Seed-VC
Zero-shot voice conversion trained according to the scheme described in SEED-TTS.  
The VC quality is surprisingly good in terms of both audio quality and timbre similarity. We decide to continue along this pathway see where it can achieve.

TODO:
- [x] Release code
- [x] Release v0.1 pretrained model: [![Hugging Face](https://img.shields.io/badge/ðŸ¤—%20Hugging%20Face-FAcodec-blue)](https://huggingface.co/Plachta/Seed-VC)
- [x] Huggingface space demo: [![Hugging Face](https://img.shields.io/badge/ðŸ¤—%20Hugging%20Face-Space-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Plachta/Seed-VC)
- [x] HTML demo page (maybe with comparisons to other VC models): [Demo](https://plachta.github.io/seed-vc/)
- [ ] Code for training on custom data
- [ ] Streaming inference
- [ ] Potential architecture improvements
- [ ] More to be added
