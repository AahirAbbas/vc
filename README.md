# Seed-VC
Zero-shot voice conversion trained according to the scheme described in SEED-TTS.  
The VC quality is surprisingly good in terms of both audio quality and timbre similarity. We decide to continue along this pathway see where it can achieve.  

TODO:
- [x] Release code
- [ ] Release v0.1 pretrained model
- [ ] Huggingface space demo
- [ ] HTML demo page (maybe with comparisons to other VC models)
- [ ] Code for training on custom data
- [ ] Streaming inference
- [ ] Potential architecture improvements
- [ ] More to be added
